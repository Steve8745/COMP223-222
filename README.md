# COMP223-222
Final Term Project：File Helper


# Introduction: 
  I have had enough of the file search function of Windows. When I enter the complete file name, I can't find it. It is very inefficient and easy to crash, so our team developed File Helper.Introduction: I have had enough of the file search function of Windows.

# Purpose of the software includes
• Process type：Agile

  Because we use a type of code that is quite unique and rare, but very simple and modular, in order to make more efficient use of our team's human resources, each of us develops different features, tests them, and then gradually integrates them together. Thanks to Batch Script, some sudden ideas can also be conveniently added without the need for major changes. 
  This avoids the waterfall model where one stage follows another, which is too slow. That's why we chose Agile.

• Possible usage of your software：
  We hope that this software can be widely used by computer enthusiasts. As for other user groups, it may not be so popular because the interface is not so accepted.


# Software development plan
• Development Process：
  Our development deadline is relatively tight, so we must make reasonable arrangements within the limited time. We first plan the required functions, analyze what code is appropriate to use, and then plan the next available time and progress goals for each person.

• Members：
P2104287 Steve - Calculate directory size / Find files
p2204960 Scott - Get directory information / Find string
p2205092 WAN KAI HIN - translation provided / Integration testing

• Schedule：
4/15 - Discussion and planning
4/17 - Implemented two functions (Calculate directory size / Get directory information)
4/17 - Separate translation version ready
4/19 - The last two functions are implemented
4/20 - The translation version is integrated and tested.

• Current status of your software：
  The set tasks have been completed so far！
  
• Future plan：
  Continue to explore some convenient functions of Batch in depth and integrate them into our projects in the future.

# Domo


# Environments of the software development and running
  In theory, all computers that can execute batch can run it. The operating systems currently available for testing are: win11, win10

  Any hardware configuration capable of executing the above system will work

# Declaration
  All development was completed by our team and gpt, and no open source or copying of other people's code was used.
